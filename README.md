Sitecore.Mvc.Areas
==================

Sitecore.Mvc.Areas is an extension to Sitecore MVC functionality that adds support for areas.
It is based on [Kevin Buckley's original implementation](http://webcmd.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/sitecore-mvc-area-controller-rendering-type/).
The code has been refactored a bit and support has been added for dependency injection with controller renderings that use fully qualified type names.
